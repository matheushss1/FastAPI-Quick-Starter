# FastAPI Quick Starter üöÄ

This repository serves as a comprehensive template and quick start guide for developing robust FastAPI applications. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with FastAPI, this template provides a solid foundation and streamlines the development process, allowing you to focus more on building your application's features.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è
**Requirements**:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.10 or higher
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

**Setting Up the Environment**:
1. Copy the contents of [.env.local](./.env.local) to a file named `.env` (modify the variables if needed) in the root directory.
2. Create a virtual environment by running the following script:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
    Note: If you only have Python 3.x installed, the command above may fail. In such cases, run:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    This will create a directory called `venv` where the binaries will be installed.
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
5. Build the [`backend` image](./Dockerfile):
    ```bash
    docker compose build
    ```
6. Generate the initial [Alembic](https://pypi.org/project/alembic/) migration:
    ```bash
        docker compose run --rm --entrypoint "sh -c" backend "alembic revision --autogenerate -m 'initial migration'"
    ```
7. Keep the [Alembic](https://pypi.org/project/alembic/) migrations head updated:
    ```bash
        docker compose run --rm --entrypoint "sh -c" backend "alembic upgrade head"
    ```
8. Start the [`backend` container](./docker-compose.yml#L9):
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d backend
    ```
    **Note 1**: The [`backend` container](./docker-compose.yml#L9) depends on the [`database` container](./docker-compose.yml#L55), which will be pulled and started automatically.
    
    **Note 2**: The `-d` flag detaches the container from the terminal, allowing you to close the terminal without stopping the container.
    
    **Note 3**: If an error occurs stating that something is running on port 80, you can change the `API_PORT` variable in your `.env` file.

9. The API should now be up and running on localhost. You can access the autogenerated Swagger documentation at [http://localhost/docs](http://localhost/docs).

## Project Structure üìÅ
**Root (./)**
- This directory contains the configuration for the app's environment, using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a dependency manager, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization, [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as the ORM, and [Alembic](https://pypi.org/project/alembic/) for database migrations.

- **Env files**: `.env.local` stores environment variables for local environments, while `.env.ci` stores variables for CI environments.

- **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)**: Poetry manages dependencies via `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`. Avoid manually editing `poetry.lock`, as it's updated automatically with `poetry` commands.

**Database**
- Configuration for [Alembic](https://pypi.org/project/alembic/) resides here.

**src**
- The heart of the application!

**src/main.py**
- Instantiates FastAPI and includes all routers.

**src/config**
- Configuration files, including [`settings.py`](./src/config/settings.py) for environment variables.

**src/core**
- Houses modules external to FastAPI, such as [`database.py`](./src/core/database.py) for PostgreSQL connections, [`email.py`](./src/core/email.py) for configuring email servers, and [`dependencies.py`](./src/core/dependencies.py) for dependency injection.

**src/managers**
- Handles application logic and database transactions.

**src/models**
- Contains data models, categorized into `pydantic` (inherited from Pydantic) and `orm` (SQLAlchemy models).

**src/routers**
- Includes all routers. Also contains an `email_templates` folder with [Jinja2 templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/) for API-sent emails.

**src/tests**
- Crucial for project integrity, this directory houses unit tests.
- [`main conftest.py`](./src/tests/conftest.py) instantiates a `TestClient` with all necessary mocks.
- `src/tests/core` tests essential API functionalities, with a current focus on health checks.
- `src/tests/models` tests models and ORM functionality.
- `src/tests/routers` contains the bulk of API router tests.

## Extending the API ‚ûï
- When adding a new router file to `src/routers`, ensure it's added to [`main.py`](./src/main.py) for availability in the API.

## Modifying ORM Models üíæ
- When adding a new data model to `src/models/orm`, import it into the [Alembic environment](./database/env.py#L20) to map the model and perform migrations.
- After changing or adding a data model, generate a migration:
    ```bash
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "(description of changes)"
    ```
    Review the generated migration file in `database/versions` to ensure it matches expectations. Keep the head updated with:
    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm --entrypoint "sh -c" backend 'alembic upgrade head'
    ```

## Running Tests üß™
- To run tests, use the following script:
    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm --entrypoint "sh -c" backend 'pytest'
    ```

    **Note**: Adjust the command to suit your testing preferences, such as:
    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm --entrypoint "sh -c" backend 'pytest -vvv'
    ```
    for increased verbosity.

## Using Poetry for Dependency Management üì¶

Poetry is a powerful dependency management tool for Python projects. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies, packaging, and publishing your project.

### Installation
If you haven't installed Poetry yet, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

### Adding Dependencies
To add dependencies to your project, use the `add` command followed by the package name and optionally the version:

```bash
poetry add package_name
```

For example, to add FastAPI:

```bash
poetry add fastapi
```

### Updating Dependencies
To update dependencies to their latest compatible version, use the `update` command:

```bash
poetry update
```

### Removing Dependencies
To remove a dependency from your project, use the `remove` command followed by the package name:

```bash
poetry remove package_name
```

### Installing Dependencies
After adding or updating dependencies, you need to install them:

```bash
poetry install
```

This command will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies specified in your `pyproject.toml` file.

### Running Scripts
You can define custom scripts in your `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.poetry.scripts]` section. To run a script, use the `run` command followed by the script name:

```bash
poetry run script_name
```

For example, if you have a script named `my_script`:

```bash
poetry run my_script
```

### Generating Lock File
Poetry generates a lock file (`poetry.lock`) to ensure deterministic builds. To regenerate the lock file, use the `lock` command:

```bash
poetry lock
```

### More Information
For more information and advanced usage of Poetry, refer to the [official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).


## Implemented Features üéâ
The API already includes endpoints for various operations:
1. **Direct User Creation**:
    - Utilize the [`create_user` route](./src/routers/user.py#L21) in the user router to create a user by providing the necessary information in the request body.
2. **User Invitation Flow**:
    - An implemented flow where users are invited via email, receive an invitation link, submit their new credentials, and are subsequently created. See [here](./src/routers/user.py#L30) and [here](./src/routers/user.py#L53).
3. **User Authorization/Authentication Flow**:
    - After creation, users can obtain an `OAuth2 Bearer Token` by submitting their email and password, allowing them to perform authorized requests. See [here](./src/routers/user.py#L62) and [here](./src/routers/user.py#L82).
